## **Protein secondary structure prediction using GOR and SVM methods**
Secondary structure prediction is a set of different tools that are able to predict the secondary structure conformation of a protein. In general, protein secondary structure prediction provides a significant first step toward tertiary structure prediction, as well as offering information about protein activity, relationships, and functions. Under these motivations, I implemented and compared two methods able to predict the secondary structure composition: a statistical approach
method named Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson (GOR) method (Garnier et al., 1978) and a machine learning approach using SVMs.
Results: The GOR approach has demonstrated to reach 59.8% of accuracy, while SVM has reached an accuracy of 63.9%. Both methods were compared to the secondary structures inferred by the DSSP program.
